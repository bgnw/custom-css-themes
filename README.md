# Custom CSS Themes

These are my custom stylesheets that I use to make sites look better (imo).

There are many extensions that you can use to automatically inject these stylesheets into sites  â€“ I use [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/ "Stylish").

Each site's stylesheet has an expanded (normal) version, and a minified version; I'd recommend you use the minified version for improved performance.

If you notice any improvements/bugs, feel free to raise an issue or contribute!
